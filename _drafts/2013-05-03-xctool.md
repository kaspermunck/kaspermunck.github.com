https://github.com/facebook/xctool

> xctool is a replacement for Apple's xcodebuild that makes it easier to build and test iOS and Mac products. It's especially helpful for continuous integration.

Facebook has released xctool which simplifies the process of building application unit tests (and much more!) from the command line significantly.

**Warning**

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Tools/RunUnitTests:68: note: RunUnitTests exited without running tests because TEST_AFTER_BUILD was set to NO.

**Fix**

Test Target -> Build Phases -> Run Script

Since we are now relying 100% on xctool, we can safely remove the build script Apple adds for us when we initialize a unit test target. Go to your test target, select Build Phases and open the Run Script tab:

````
# Run the unit tests in this test bundle.
"${SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR}/Tools/RunUnitTests"
````

Remove this.

It's obvious to use a continous integration server to run your tests, but why not run the project as well, now it's this easy?
