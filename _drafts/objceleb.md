## Introducing the Objetive Celebrity

I spend a not insignificant amount of time on keeping myself up-to-date with whatever happens in the world of technology. A great deal of that time is spent researching new areas of iOS and Objective-C. I always wind up sending myself "read later"-emails, which has an unfortunate side effect, i.e. I spam my own mailbox with tweets and links and quotes. Sure, [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com) makes the day for a lot of people like myself, but sometimes, a stream of short pieces of fresh and relevant information, silver bullets and links would be great.

In a world full of [NSHipsters](http://nshipster.com) and [Cocoa Samurais](http://cocoasamurai.com), gigantic amounts of incredibly interesting information is floating in the [(Objective) sea](http://objectivesea.tumblr.com). Therefore, let me introduce you to the [Objective Celebrity](http://objective-celebrity.com). He collects and shares useful iOS and Objective-C stuff.

It started out as my own private stream, but as we all know, sharing is caring; if I can benefit from this, someone else might too. Now, when I stumble upon something interesting, I kindly ask The Celebrity to [tweet](https://twitter.com/objcelebrity). Then I return to him later to browse through and read the latest of interest. Convenient.
