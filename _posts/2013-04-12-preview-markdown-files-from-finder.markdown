As a mac user I use Preview (hover a file, hit space) all the time when browsing code and text files in Finder. However, Preview doesn't know how to handle a markdown (`.md` or `.markdown`) file. During an attempt to find a solution, an intense session of power Googling lead me to discover an interesting script: [QLMarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/). 

> QLMarkdown is is a simple QuickLook generator for Markdown files.

I found it in [Support for Markdown in OSX](http://jamesmoss.co.uk/blog/support-for-markdown-in-osx-quicklook/) on [James Moss' blog](http://jamesmoss.co.uk/), where he also explains how to install it. It works flawlessly and is definitely an asset if [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is your preferred tool for writing.
