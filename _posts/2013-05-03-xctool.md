Facebook just released [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool), a tool intended to replace Apple's `xcodebuild`, which has been the command line tool for building iOS and OS X projects so far.

> xctool is a replacement for Apple's xcodebuild that makes it easier to build and test iOS and Mac products. It's especially helpful for continuous integration.

Xctool simplifies the process of building application unit tests (and much more!) from the command line significantly. Recently I wrote about [How To Run Application Unit Tests with Travis-CI](http://kaspermunck.github.io/2013/04/running-kiwi-specs-with-travis-ci/), addressing the issue with [running application unit tests from the command line](https://github.com/sgleadow/xcodetest). It turned out that additional effort is required to be able to run application unit tests from the command line. That's past now.

To demonstrate how easy xctool is to use, we'll create a dummy sample app, MyApp, with a unit test target. We'll then both build the project and run it's test cases via xctool.

### MyApp

Create a new Xcode project, MyApp, of type Single View Application and check Include Unit Tests.

Then add a new scheme, MyAppTests, for the unit test target, whose name is most likely to be MyAppTests as well.

xctool doesn't support building targets using `-target` as xcodebuild does, hence the need of schemes. It encourages you to indicate a scheme to build and then you can specify a desired target with the `-only` flag (and further details such as a certain test class and even a specific test case).

### xctool

Clone the source [from Github](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) into the root of MyApp project (the folder with MyApp.xcodeproj). Then run:

`xctool/xctool.sh -project MyApp.xcodeproj -scheme MyApp build`

That's everything required to build the project. You can build and run tests, build the test target and run it against multiple SDK's, build the project or a workspace and a whole lot of other cool things. To run the tests (i.e. the unimplemented dummy test that's added by default), run:

`xctool/xctool.sh -project MyApp.xcodeproj -scheme MyAppTests test`

This runs all tests in MyAppTests in the simulator, so both logic- and application unit tests will be run without any problems. It's really that simple. I made a [test project](https://github.com/kaspermunck/xctool-travis-test) to check it's [compatibility with Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/kaspermunck/xctool-travis-test), and (after a [minor fix](https://github.com/facebook/xctool/issues/11)) it works very well.

### Disable Unit Test Runner

The unit test target Xcode adds for us when checking Include Unit Tests runs a build script named `RunUnitTests`. If you take a closer look at the output from xctool, you will notice this message:

````
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Tools/RunUnitTests:68: note: RunUnitTests exited without running tests because TEST_AFTER_BUILD was set to NO.
````
Although it doesn't do any harm, it's annoying, so let's remove it. Click on MyApp project in Project Navigator and select MyAppTests target. Under `Build Phases -> Run Script` it says:

````
# Run the unit tests in this test bundle.
"${SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR}/Tools/RunUnitTests"
````

Since we are now relying 100% on xctool, we can safely remove the build script Xcode adds for us when we initialize a unit test target. Run the tests again and the message is no longer showing.

### Build Errors

I experienced two errors when building MyApp project with the following command:

`xctool/xctool.sh -project MyApp.xcodeproj -scheme MyApp build
`

The first was a code signing error:

````
Code Sign error: A valid provisioning profile matching the application's Identifier 'dk.muncken.MyApp' could not be found
````

You get rid of this either by signing the project properly or you can specify the SDK to be the iphonesimulator (add `-sdk iphonesimulator`) and thereby omit code signing.

The second was an architecture error:

````
No architectures to compile for (ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES, active arch=x86_64, VALID_ARCHS=armv7 armv7s).
````

To get rid of this one, go to project settings and then under Architectures, change [Build Active Architecture Only](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/2010/04/21/xcode-build-active-architecture-only.html) to `NO`.
