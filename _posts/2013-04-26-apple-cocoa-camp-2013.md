Yesterday I received an email from Apple reading: 

> You've been selected to attend Cocoa Camp 2013 in Cupertino, CA from August 12 through August 16.

Never has one email caused happiness to such a degree; words cannot describe the feeling. But I was also extremely surprised. I learned about Cocoa Camp late thursday (April 4th), one day prior to application deadline. Despite the serious lack of time I decided to give it a go, mainly as a challenge to see if I could actually produce something proper within such a short time. Apparently I could.
