Yesterday I received an email from Apple reading: 

> You've been selected to attend [Cocoa Camp 2013](http://aquarium.apple.com/images/staffing/Cocoa_Camp_2013.pdf) in Cupertino, CA from August 12 through August 16.

Never has one email caused happiness to such a degree; words cannot describe the feeling. But I was also extremely surprised. I learned about Cocoa Camp late thursday (April 4th), one day prior to application deadline. Despite the serious lack of time I decided to give it a go, mainly as a challenge to see if I could actually produce something proper within such a short time; at that time I didn't believe that I would stand a chance. It turned out very well and here I am. 

I was already signed up for a [summer school in Shanghai](http://www.iha.dk/Course-description-CD-DIP-2013-9311.aspx) in July, and now Cocoa Camp in August. I think this summer will be a good one!
