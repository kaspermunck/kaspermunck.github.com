  	<h2>Releasing Stock Gains for iOS</h2>
    <time class="date">May 23, 2014</time>
    <p>Roughly a week ago I released an iOS app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stock-gains/id867711886?mt=8">Stock Gains</a>. Stock Gains has been a hobby project for the past 6 months and I am very proud of the result.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not an intermediate investor, but I have do sometimes invest my savings in stocks. Partly because I think stock trading is an extremely interesting area and partly because, well, then I simply can&#39;t spend the money.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used several different (both free and paid) stock- and portfolio apps, but none of them really did it for me. I found that these kind of apps typically fall into one of two categories: Either they are too simple or they are too complex. Besides that, there&#39;s a tendency that stock apps for iOS look like, you know... Certainly not all, but many do!</p>

<p>As someone in the field of engineering, the most obvious thing to do is just creating something better yourself. So that&#39;s what I decided to do. At first I wanted to create it for personal use only, but soon I realized that I wasn&#39;t the only person who didn&#39;t like the apps currently on the App Store. In other words: Demand existed.</p>

<h3>Building the app</h3>

<p>As mentioned, I&#39;ve spent 6 months on building the first version of the app. I really wanted to build the best product possible and experiment with what I&#39;ve learned through the past year working at <a href="http://www.trifork.com">Trifork</a> as an iOS developer. However, given that I&#39;m still a full-time student, possess a part-time job and live with my significant other, my time for hobby projects has been limited. Combined with being a perfectionist it yields a very long development process.</p>

<p>Being a perfectionist is good, but at some point you have to release. I&#39;ve refined, refactored and re-designed a million times. Then one day I read a quote (by the founder of Linkedin, I think), which went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are not embarrassed by the first release, you have released too late.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When publishing work, such as an app, you put a piece of yourself out there. That quote made me realize that I was afraid of being embarrassed. Users might like it, enjoy using it. Or they might hate it! This is scary, but also really exciting. I decided to wrap up what I was currently working on and then submit it. There&#39;s always a next version! So on tuesday May 13th, Stock Gains version 1.0.1 was finally on the App Store.</p>

<p>One thing that I am particularly happy with is the help and support I have received from competent people around me. This includes feature suggestions and feedback from economists and a professional trader, legal advide from a lawyer, tax insights from an auditor and thorough testing by other software engineers. These extra efforts are what makes Stock Gains a fine app!</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.aktieapp.dk/en">From the app&#39;s site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stock Gains shows you the value of your portfolio. Monitor day-by-day changes and calculate your net gains after taxes, while studying historical data and reading the latest news about your stocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This description pretty much sums up the functionality, which is basically what you would expect from these kinds of apps. However, there&#39;s one feature that separates if from existing apps: The capital gain calculator. </p>

<p>Usually, stock apps consider <em>current price - acquisition price</em> as the gain (or loss), but in reality taxation applies. Capital gain tax regulations vary from country to country and can be difficult to understand, but in order to get a more precise result, it must be considered. Capital gains calculations are currently supported for US and Danish stocks. More will be added over time.</p>
